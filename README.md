# FederatedLearning

Repository containing the code developed for the **Federated Learning** course at UNICAMP (MO839) — Institute of Computing.

---

## ✅ Overview

This project gathers implementations and experiments related to Federated Learning, designed to study and practice the concepts presented in the course. Users can configure various parameters (e.g., dataset, number of clients, communication rounds, etc.) through a configuration file.

---

## 💡 Key Features

* Training machine learning models using a **federated** approach (e.g., FedAvg algorithm).
* Flexible configuration through a **JSON** file — making it easy to adapt for different datasets, number of clients, communication rounds, and aggregation strategies.
* Clear organization of code and results, enabling easy replication and comparison of experiments.
* Easily extendable: you can add new datasets, models, or aggregation protocols by modifying only specific parts of the code (or configuration), without restructuring the entire project.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

The project is built in Python, leveraging widely used libraries in Machine Learning and Federated Learning:

* **Python** — Main programming language.
* **Flower** — Federated Learning framework, highly modular and simple to use.
* **PyTorch** — Used for defining and training Deep Learning models.
* **NumPy** and **Pandas** — Essential for data manipulation, processing, and analysis.
* **Matplotlib** — Visualization of results, metric charts, and round evolution.
* **Scikit-Learn** — Computation of metrics, train/test splitting, and evaluation utilities.
* **OpenCV** — Loading and processing the dataset images.
* **argparse** — Command-line argument handling (e.g., `--config`).
* **Jupyter Notebooks** — For prototyping, visualization, and demonstrations.
* **JSON** — Configuration file format for experiments.
* **Git / GitHub** — Version control.

## 📁 Project Structure

The modular structure makes it easy to run and reproduce experiments:

* **`results/`**: Directory where the results generated by the experiments are stored.
* **`src/`**: Contains all modules and scripts required for running Federated Learning.
    * `src/config/config.json`: JSON file with the configuration for federated training.
    * `src/data_processing`: Files related to dataset handling.
    * `src/flower`: Files related to clients/server/simulation/aggregation logic.
    * `src/models`: Files related to model definition and training metrics.
    * `src/notebooks`: Notebooks used during the development on Google Colab.
    * `src/validations`: Files related to benchmark evaluations.
    * `src/main.py`: Main entry point for running the FL server.
* **`.gitignore`**: Git ignore file.
* **`README.md`**: Project documentation.

## 🎯 How to Use / Run Experiments

1. **Clone this repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/LuisLVieira/FederatedLearning
    cd FederatedLearning
    ```

2. **Configure the experiment:**
    Navigate to the `src/config/` folder and edit the **`config.json`** file. Set the desired parameters (number of clients, dataset, number of rounds, etc.).

3. **Run federated training:**
    Start the execution by specifying the configuration file path:
    ```bash
    python main.py --config src/config/config.json
    ```

4. **Analysis:**
    The results, logs, and performance metrics will be automatically saved in the `results/` directory for later analysis.

> ⚠️ Depending on the chosen dataset or model, you may need to install additional libraries or adjust configurations (e.g., data paths, train/test split, preprocessing steps, etc.).

## 🧪 Usage Examples

You can use this repository to:

* Study how federated algorithms behave under different scenarios (e.g., **non-IID** data, different numbers of clients, data heterogeneity).
* Test various ML model architectures in a federated environment.
* Compare results between executions (with different seeds, configurations, datasets) in a reproducible way.
* Adapt the project to new datasets or domains by simply modifying the configuration or preprocessing steps.

## ✨ Final Remarks

This repository serves as a **foundation** for hands-on exploration of Federated Learning — suitable for study, experimentation, and prototyping within the MO839 course context. Its simple and modular structure makes it easy to adapt for other scenarios or future projects.

If you plan to add new modules, datasets, or experiments, consider preserving the existing organization (`src/`, `results/`, clear configurations) to ensure reproducibility and clarity.
